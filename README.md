## mockup - Just mock up for the codestand-io

### Motto

* Programmable mockup as a specification
* Show the direction of the road ahead visually.
* No necessity to do all things.

### Roadmap

#### Mockup (first-step)

* Slim (markup)
* Coffee (client)
* Sass (ui)

#### Make it portable (second-step)

* Slim (markup)
* JavaScript with Babel (client)
* Postcss (ui)

### Run

    $ bundle exec rackup

### Others

* server-side: `app/*.rb`
* client-side: `app/views/*.slim`

Thanks.
