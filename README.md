## :hammer: mockup - Just mock up for codestand-io

### :hankey: Motto

* Programmable mockup as a specification of data
* Show the direction of the road ahead visually
* No necessity to do all things

### :runner: Run

    $ bundle exec rackup

### :heavy_check_mark: Structure

* server-side: `app/*.rb`
* client-side: `app/views/*.slim`

### :checkered_flag: Roadmap

#### Mockup (first-step)

* Slim (markup)
* Coffee (client)
* Sass (ui)

#### Make it portable (second-step)

* Slim (markup)
* JavaScript with Babel (client)
* Postcss (ui)

Thanks.
