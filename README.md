## :hammer: mockup - Just mock up for codestand-io

### 0. Motto :sparkles: 

* Programmable mockup as a data specification
* Show the direction of the road ahead visually
* No necessity to do all things

### 1. Run :runner:

    $ bundle exec rackup

### 2. Structure :heavy_check_mark:

* server-side: `app/*.rb`
* client-side: `app/views/*.slim`

### 3. Roadmap :checkered_flag:

1. Mockup (first-step)
  - with Slim (markup) / Coffee (client) / Sass (ui)
2. Make it portable (second-step)
  - Slim (markup) / JavaScript with Babel (client) / Postcss (ui) 
3. E2E testing (third-step)

Cheers!
