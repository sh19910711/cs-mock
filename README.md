## :hammer: mockup - Just mock up for codestand-io

### 0. Motto :hankey:

* Programmable mockup as a specification of data
* Show the direction of the road ahead visually
* No necessity to do all things

### 1. Run :runner:

    $ bundle exec rackup

### 2. Structure :heavy_check_mark:

* server-side: `app/*.rb`
* client-side: `app/views/*.slim`

### 3. Roadmap :checkered_flag:

#### Mockup (first-step)

* Slim (markup)
* Coffee (client)
* Sass (ui)

#### Make it portable (second-step)

* Slim (markup)
* JavaScript with Babel (client)
* Postcss (ui)
